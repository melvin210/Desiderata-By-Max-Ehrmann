        <br>
        <h2>By Max Ehrmann</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Go placidly amid the noise and the haste,</p>
        <p>and remember what peace there may be in silence.</p>
        <p>As far as possible, without surrender,</p>
        <p>be on good terms with all persons.</p>
        <p>Speak your truth quietly and clearly;</p>
        <p>and listen to others,</p>
        <p>even to the dull and the ignorant;</p>
        <p>they too have their story.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Avoid loud and aggressive persons;</p>
        <p>they are vexatious to the spirit.</p>
        <p>If you compare yourself with others,</p>
        <p>you may become vain or bitter,</p>
        <p>for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.</p>
        <p>Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.</p>
        <p>Keep interested in your own career, however humble;</p>
        <p>it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Exercise caution in your business affairs,</p>
        <p>for the world is full of trickery.</p>
        <p>But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;</p>
        <p>many persons strive for high ideals,</p>
        <p>and everywhere life is full of heroism.</p>
        <p>Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection.</p>
        <p>Neither be cynical about love;</p>
        <p>for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment,</p>
        <p>it is as perennial as the grass.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Take kindly the counsel of the years,</p>
        <p>gracefully surrendering the things of youth.</p>
        <p>Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.</p>
        <p>But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.</p>
        <p>Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Beyond a wholesome discipline,</p>
        <p>be gentle with yourself.</p>
        <p>You are a child of the universe</p>
        <p>no less than the trees and the stars;</p>
        <p>you have a right to be here.</p>
        <p>And whether or not it is clear to you,</p>
        <p>no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Therefore, be at peace with God,</p>
        <p>whatever you conceive Him to be.</p>
        <p>And whatever your labors and aspirations,</p>
        <p>in the noisy confusion of life,</p>
        <p>keep peace in your soul.</p>
        <p>With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,</p>
        <p>it is still a beautiful world.</p>
        <p>Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="author">Max Ehrmann, the author of "Desiderata," wrote this poem in 1927, and it has since become a widely beloved work that emphasizes acceptance, peace, and finding one's place in the world.</p>
